# CP468_FinalProject
 CP468 - Artificial Intelligence Final Project. Analysis of College/University Data 

We analzye a dataset from a 1995 U.S. News data analysis exposition.
Throught the use of Machine learning libaries to test relationships between certain financial and academic indactor variables as well as against success indicator variables -- graduation rate.
There is a specifc use of Linear regression & K-means models in this code, which we found best fit to test against out regression & inference problem.
We find that through the use of our models and analyzing the dataset that we came to the conclusion that money spent on post-secondary education is a greater indicator of success than actual academic acuity entering post-secondary education.

Here is a link to the dataset being used:

We use several external libaries for this project, such as:
matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and sklearn.

To pip install these libraries do the following:
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy
- pip install seaborn
- pip install sklearn

To execute our code simply run the file: CollegeDataTest.py
It will output to the console any useful info along with graphs.
